# Homework 9
This homework focuses on using regular expression to split or extract information from text, as well as using Postgres' full text search features. You'll initially be using `fables.txt` and cleaning and parsing the data into a nicer tabular form, before doing some analysis. You won't need `make_animals.sql` until the analysis. Don't forget to upload CSV files of any tables you were asked to create if you haven't copied them into your solutions elsewhere.
